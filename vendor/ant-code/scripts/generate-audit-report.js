  "## Runtime Boundary Summary",
  "",
  "- Public command name is `ant-code`; `lab-agent` remains an internal compatibility alias.",
  "- User-facing diagnostics and rollout material use the Ant Code public name while protocol, config, and metadata compatibility anchors remain stable.",
  "- Model gateway metadata declares the intended boundary: local client tool execution, gateway-only provider credentials, and no MVP remote tools.",
  "- Release seal checks validate clean-room attestation material, runtime source markers, public identity, package privacy, reviewed runtime dependency evidence, and local tool/model-adapter boundary evidence.",
  "- Dependency policy checks validate reviewed runtime dependencies, package-lock integrity, and npm-shrinkwrap parity for packed internal releases.",
  "- Release candidate packaging includes a generated RC summary and human-readable acceptance summary for lab review.",
  "- Model traffic is configured only by `LAB_MODEL_GATEWAY_URL`, `LAB_MODEL_GATEWAY_PROTOCOL`, and optional gateway adapter auth.",
  "- Gateway health diagnostics are configured only by `LAB_MODEL_GATEWAY_HEALTH_URL` and are never contacted unless a gateway health command is run with live mode.",
  "- Gateway requests include non-sensitive compatibility metadata, and gateway errors include redacted diagnostic hints.",
  "- Doctor checks deployment readiness for CLI bins, config sources, gateway settings, allowed hosts, metadata policy, MCP servers, provenance, and release audit material.",
  "- Network default is `lab-only`; `offline` permits loopback only.",
  "- MCP is explicit local stdio only in MVP.",
  "- Read-only local git tools provide bounded status and diff output without shell interpolation.",
  "- Repository maps are derived locally from manifests and top-level directories for status, next-action, report, and map commands without persisting raw source contents.",
  "- User-facing local commands use consistent sectioned text output, with `/status --json` reserved for machine-readable automation.",
  "- Command help is grouped by workflow area, and approval prompts name the local execution boundary before risky actions.",
  "- Release candidate deployment material defines freeze criteria, evidence bundles, high-sensitivity rollout requirements, and rollback steps.",
  "- Lab user quickstart material covers first run, gateway setup, daily workflow, sensitive-data mode, and rollback.",
  "- Local installation readiness checks validate CLI bin wiring, Node entrypoint shape, install docs, and startup commands.",
  "- Edit tools provide exact-replacement preflight, dry-run diff previews, stable error codes, replacement-count validation, byte summaries, and bounded diffs before writes.",
  "- `/verify suggest`, `/verify run suggested`, and `/next` connect local validation suggestions to the delivery workflow without persisting raw command output.",
  "- Transcripts/session metadata are local, bounded, retention-limited, can be zero-retention for high-sensitivity projects, and can be encrypted with local key material.",
  "- High-sensitivity mode forces zero-retention metadata and restricts network mode to offline or lab-only.",
  "- Every model turn receives clean-room Ant Code behavior and final-response protocol context through the lab gateway request.",
  "- Delivery status includes a derived task lifecycle stage and detects stale passing validations when later file changes exist.",
  "- Conversation context is budgeted and older turns compact into bounded redacted process-local summaries; persisted metadata stores only context counts and byte totals.",
  "- Interactive chat keeps bounded session context, session-local todo/plan state, recorded changes, validation history, redacted failed-validation repair context, delivery status and concrete next-action hints, review/next/report commands, metadata-only resume, context clearing/compaction, and local per-tool approval prompts; print mode still requires explicit approval flags.",
  "- Ink TUI v1.2 renders the same clean-room session runtime with a modularized local TUI implementation, Chinese-first common UI copy, TUI-owned transcript scrolling, pinned side panels, command panels, queue/session/resume workflows, model-summary-first context compaction, file-by-file patch browsing, diff/patch highlighting for command/tool details, multi-line composer, local approval prompts, and non-TTY fallback.",
  "- v1.0-v1.4 acceptance records cover the clean-room base, TUI experience, local extension runtime, and orchestration milestones.",
  "- v3.0 Dashboard acceptance records the WebUI surface, transcript paging, SSE recovery, session actions, change statistics, packaging, known limitations, and rollback procedure.",
  "- Write and mutating shell tools require explicit local session approval.",
  "",
  "## Open Release Risks",
  "",
  "- Stage 8 extension depth is partial by release decision: richer skills/task/background/branch/rewind panels and write-capable subagents remain deferred.",
  "- Real lab gateway compatibility should be validated against the deployed gateway before broad model-enabled rollout.",
  "- Dependency audit is package-manifest based; if future dependencies are installed, package metadata should be present locally before release audit generation.",
