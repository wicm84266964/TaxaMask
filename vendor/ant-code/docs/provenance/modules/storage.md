design_notes:
  - Stores local session metadata only.
  - Stores bounded turn metadata without raw prompts or assistant outputs.
  - Redacts secret-like keys before writing JSON.
  - Skips new local metadata writes when transcript persistence is disabled or retention is zero.
  - Honors high-sensitivity config indirectly through the zero-retention transcript policy.
  - Supports AES-256-GCM encrypted local metadata when configured with local key material.
  - Lists, reads, decrypts, and cleans local session metadata using a retention-day policy.
  - Does not upload transcripts or crash/session metadata.

# Storage Provenance

The storage module is local-only and aligned with transcript retention requirements.
